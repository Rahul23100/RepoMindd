# RepoMind AI ðŸ¤– - GitHub Repository Analyzer

RepoMind is a web application built with Streamlit and powered by Google's Gemini AI. It clones any public GitHub repository, analyzes its recent commit history, and provides a high-level technical summary.

This tool is perfect for developers, managers, or students who want to quickly understand the purpose, key features, and recent activity of a GitHub project without reading through all the code.

-   **Secure API Key Handling**: Uses Streamlit's password input to keep your Gemini API key safe.
